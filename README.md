# Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that catches many people out when first encountered. Vos Savant presented a solution that was, initially, rejected in the popular media of the day.

The aim of this project is to demonstrates that Vos Savant is correct.

You will need to:

- [x] Gain an understanding of the problem.
- [x] Convince yourself that Vos Savant was correct.
- [x] Design and write software that will run sample games employing either the stick or switch strategy.
- [x] Put the code in a public GitHub repository
- [x] Use your software to show that switching doors is statistically the best option.

## User Stroies
As an user I will be able to :
- [x] Select a door
- [x] Keep or switch my choice
- [x] Switch between play mode and simulation mode
- [x] Run simulation for *n* number of times for keep/switch choice selection
- [x] See the proof that switching doors is statistically the best option.
